\-1- A better career

1\. Better career opportunity. The open source job market is booming and companies need talent to drive their business. Open source project can add value to the company, such as building a cloud platform and enhancing the influence of the company. Open source jobs are often strongly technology-related and community-based, with no geographic restrictions, which is flexible.

2\. Improve personal skills. It’s a great way to strengthen your hard skills and your soft skills. Participating in top-level open source projects can improve your technical skills. Your soft skills will be correspondingly improved, such as English, collaborative capabilities, operational capabilities, etc. To create a new open source project, innovation capability will also be improved in the pioneering work.

3\. Interpersonal relationship development. The participants will no longer only focus on internal activities such as salary and KPI, attention will also be paid to external activities such as technical exchanges, conferences, articles writing, and even capital injection. It can also help make more international friends. 

4\. Public recognition. The process and the outcome of open source projects are open, which means that the efforts of participants will not be in vain. The risk of private projects within the company is relatively greater than that of open source projects. The evaluation criteria for private projects depend on the project leader. If the project leader does not approve, all the efforts will be in vain. However, open source projects are different. The whole work is available, accessible, and modifiable to everyone. The fact that it is public and open to all means that it is not limited to the judgment of the leader.

1\. Self-growth. People who have passion for what you do will find pleasure in the process. Employees in the software industry needs to be highly self-motivated. Passion for programming is a shortcut to success, with which people can experience happiness brought by self-growth despite challenges.

2\.  A sense of accomplishment. Industry recognition will bring a huge sense of accomplishment. You will find happiness in your chosen career by self-growth and project improvement. Recognition for the project will make you feel a sense of accomplishment.
