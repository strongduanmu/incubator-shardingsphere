## Congratulations on graduation of Apache ShardingSphere as a Top-Level Project!


Wakefield, MA, April 16, 2020 -- The world's largest open source software foundation, the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), announced Apache ShardingSphere as a Top-Level Project (TLP).

ShardingSphere was submitted to the Apache Incubator and entered incubation in November 2018. Afterwards, under the guidance of the mentor, the members of the Incubator Project Management Committee (IPMC) effectively manages the process of incubation. On March 28, 2020, the proposal for graduation was put to the Apache Foundation's Incubator for a vote and approved with 10 votes in favor.

On April 15, the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) board has passed the resolution for ShardingSphere to graduate from the Apache Incubator to become a top-level project, ending the 17-month incubation. And Vice President of Marketing and Publicity at The Apache Software Foundation, Sally Khudairi announced it on the official channels of the Apache Software Foundation. ShardingSphere is the first Top-Level Project to graduate from Apache incubator in 2020.

Apache ShardingSphere is an open-source ecosystem, which has 3 sub-projects that form the database solutions, for ShardingSphere-JDBC, ShardingSphere-Proxy and ShardingSphere-Sidecar (TODO). ShardingSphere originated from Dangdang and developed in JD Digital Technology, becoming the first Apache distributed database middleware project.

Graduation as a Top-Level Project reflects the efforts of the Apache ShardingSphere community over the past year and a half. Since entering the Apache incubator, ShardingSphere has evolved from a JDBC driver for sharding into a distributed ecosystem.

Thanks to our mentors, contributors, and the Apache Incubator for their support, especially during the period of the coronavirus outbreak. Moreover, we are very pleased to see that the community has been active and diverse, with the involvement of more than 120 contributors from all over the world.
